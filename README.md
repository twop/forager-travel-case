# Overview
Travel case for an amazing keyboard [Forager](https://github.com/carrefinho/forager) designed by [carrefinho](https://github.com/carrefinho).

Primarily designed by my friend [Jacob](https://github.com/freakerepo) for me <3 with my humble input and original sketches.

## Features
- 4 parts designed to be 3D printed without support
- Magnetic latch, uses 24 10mm×3mm round magnets (press fit but can be glued)
- Integrated storage for the original tenting legs
- Case covers serve dual purpose as wrist rests
- Compact, but should have enough space for taller keycaps like [Lame](https://github.com/braindefender/KLP-Lame-Keycaps/)
- Simple: no glue or screws required

## Bill of Materials
I'm going to use Amazon links, but these should be widely accessible. And some can be reused from the Forager build.

- 24× neodymium magnets: 10mm diameter × 3mm thick. [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7C7GG9W) 
- 4× 10mm diameter 3mm thick hemisphere rubber pads from the Forager build guide, something like [that](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G8926LH) 
- [Grip sticker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTT75B19)
- 2× 8mm×3mm rods from the Forager build guide, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M9TT4P2)
